# ProjectForecast

This android application is developed to connect to the Project Forecast esp32 microcontroller. Using this application you can connect to nearby Forecast Scanners and collect and save four different environmental variables, pressure, relative humidity, surface temperature, and ambient temperature. 

The application can be configured so that when environment variables are saved they are associated with different locations or animals. IE saving a humidity/temperature reading for Barn A or saving a skin temperature value for Sow B. This will allow a history of environmental variables to be kept so that the effect of the environment on the growth of animals

This app was developed for an 8-inch tablet so the display may not visually fit onto a smaller devices.
